# bookie
a simple view of books and when they came out from authors via the OpenLibrary api

### reason
made to view books from the openlibrary api using newer front-end technologies such as react-query and more

### things to add
* the usage of tailwind for styling
* trpc
* potential post requests
* author search
* linking (changed from react-router, needs updating from react-query)
